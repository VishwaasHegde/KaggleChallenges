1. Remove outliers
2. Can apply log(1+x) transformation on the y label
3. Convert non-numeric features as str
4. Fill the na as other category
5. if nas are only present in test, then fill it with mode (for cat)
6. Calculate the skewness for all numerical variables, and then apply boxcox1p for variables with skew>0.5 to bring their distributions to guassian
7. ohe using pd.get_dummies
8. If a feature has more than 99.x % of the values belonging to just 1 value, drop it
9. Use robust scaler to normalize by avoiding outliers
10. Use multiple regressors and then use StackingCVRegressor.
11. Finally combine all models with their weights
